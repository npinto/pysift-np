PySift Version 0.1 - Dylan Sale 2008

This code is a lightweight wrapper for sift++ as described below. At the current time, it has only been tested with Visual Studio 2008 Express on Windows XP.
Paths may have to be set up in the Project file to get it to compile. 
The file siftmodule.cpp and the python examples were created by me, all else are the standard sift++ files.

CHANGES
  0.7.4  Better Makefile.
  0.7.3  Another bug fix introduced in 0.7.1.
  0.7.2  Fixed a bug introduced with 0.7.1.
  0.7.1  Tuned a few parameters to better match D. Lowe.
  0.7.0  --unnormalized, --floating-point, --magnif
         Bug fixes (thanks to Brian).
  0.6.7  Bug fixes (thanks to Loic).
  0.6.6  Bug fixes (thanks to Giuseppe).
  0.6.5  Bug fixes (thanks to Liu).
  0.6.4  Added -I. to Makefile.
  0.6.3  Minor bug fixes (thanks to Erwin).
  0.6.2  Minor bug fixes. Minor corrections to the man page.
  0.6.1  Removed a bug affecting the downsampling of oddly sized images.
  0.6.0  Introduced --stable-order option.
  0.5.6  Fixed a minor bug in the convolution code. Increased the default
         number of octaves that get computed.
  0.5.5  More bug fixes (PGM parsing error)
  0.5.4  New switch VL_LOWE_STRICT. This enables features that simulate
         even more closely Lowe's implementation (it does even
         simulate a small 'bug').
  0.5.3  Bug fixes (thanks to P. Ivanov).
  0.5.2  Man page.
  0.5.1  Changed the way image boundaries are handled in the computation
         of the scalespace (thanks to Q.S.Luo for indicating the
         problem). This makes the algorithm even closer to
         Lowe's. Inital version of the manpage.
  0.5    Optionally reads keypoint frames from file. Improved interface.
  0.4    Faster (and approximated) computations. Binary descriptor output.
  0.3    Added `--threshold' and `--edge-threshold' opitons to the
         command line driver.
  0.2.2  Corrected a bug in the resolution of the 3x3 linear system.
         (thanks to Fan Gu for finding this out)
  0.2.1  Corrected a bug in the command line driver.
  0.2    Made LAPACK independent.
  0.1    Initial version.
